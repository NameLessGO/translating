# Translating Anki's User Interface

Anki's translations are divided up into two parts:

- The `core` module contains text common to both the computer version
and AnkiMobile, and could potentially be used by AnkiDroid in the future as well.
It's built with a new translation system, and is the easiest place to start.
- The `desktop` and `desktop-ftl` modules contain text only used in the computer version
 of Anki. `desktop-ftl` uses the new translation system, but currently only contains
a few strings.
