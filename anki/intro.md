# Translating Anki's User Interface

Anki's translations are divided up into two parts:

- The `core` module contains text common to both the computer version
and AnkiMobile. It's built with a new translation system, and is the
easiest place to start.
- The `desktop` module contains text only used in the computer version
 of Anki.
