# Desktop Interface

The majority of Anki's interface is now included in the `core` module. `desktop-ftl`
contains some strings specific to the computer version, such add-ons. The strings
were mostly automatically migrated from Anki's old translation system, so there
may be some strings in core that only apply to the computer version, or vice versa.
