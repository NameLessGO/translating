# The Manual

Translating the manual is trickier than translating Anki's interface.

If you're a fairly technical user, you can fork the manual's repo,
and translate one or more of
[the manual's text files](https://github.com/ankitects/anki-manual).

After translating at least one file, please get in touch.
