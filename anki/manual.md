# The Manual

The user manual is currently a single file, and thus a bit difficult to
translate.

If you're a fairly technical user, you may want to translate the
[source file](https://raw.github.com/dae/ankidocs/master/manual.txt) of the
manual, and compile it yourself with asciidoc. You can also use that GitHub
repo to keep track of changes to the manual in the future.

If that sounds complicated, an easier way is to visit this page and use
File>Save As to save the manual to disk. You can then import it into Microsoft
Word or similar software, and translate it that way.

When you're happy with the translation, you can either put it up on your
website and we can link to it, or we can host the translated file on Anki's
website (but if you're planning to make frequent updates, the former is a
better choice). If you'd like, you can post it before you're done and we can
link to it in the list of in-progress translations below.
