# Translating AnkiMobile's UI

AnkiMobile uses the same translation site as the computer version.

The translations are divided up into two parts:

- The `core` module contains text common to both the computer version
and AnkiMobile.  It's built with a new translation system, and is the
easiest place to start.
- The `mobile` module contains text only used in AnkiMobile.

If you have not signed up to the translation site yet, please see
[Getting Started](./intro.md).

Please start with the `core` module, which is [documented here](../anki/core.md).
Once the `core` module is fully translated in your language, you can then
move on to the `mobile` module, which is covered next.
