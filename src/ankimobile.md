# AnkiMobile

AnkiMobile's translations are divided into two parts:

- The `core` module contains text common to both the computer version
  and AnkiMobile.
- The `mobile` module contains text only used in AnkiMobile.

If you have not signed up to the translation site yet, please see
[Getting Started](./intro.md).

Please start with the `core` module, which is [documented here](./anki/core.md).
Once the `core` module is mostly translated in your language, you can then
move on to the `mobile` module.

When translations are nearing completion, please reach out on the support site,
as new languages need to be manually added to the build process.

Once a new language has been added, your translations will be visible in
subsequent beta builds and app store releases. Please give the betas a try, so
you can see how your translations appear in the app. If you're not already a
beta tester, please [request an invite](https://docs.ankimobile.net/beta-testing.html)
on the support site.

When translating, please try to keep the translations about the same
length as the original English text. If it is not possible, and you find
that text is not appearing properly in a beta (such as two labels
overlapping), please report the issue on the support site.

Thank you again for your help!
